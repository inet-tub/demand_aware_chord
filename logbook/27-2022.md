* [quicksum](https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/9.5/refman/py_quicksum.html) -> very helpful
* SP-ILP implemented, is even more inefficient than the first ILP (flow-constraint), because we need a 3-D Helper array for the DP
* [mipfocus](https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/9.1/refman/mipfocus.html)
### What I can try tomorrow
* set [Presolve](https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/9.1/refman/presolve.html),[Cuts](https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/9.1/refman/cuts.html) 
* use [Parameter Tuning Tool](https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/9.1/refman/parameter_tuning_tool.html)

* Conditions I look for in real datasets:
⋅⋅1. Connected
⋅⋅2. Directed with weights, But undirected can be turned into directed etc.
Optimally: All-pair connected graph with weights -> So that the weights can be turned into a Demand matrix
Datasets from Robert, which might be usable:
* Prosper loans: turn borrower into single entity, then use credit grade + rating of borrower for weights

* Last.fm songs, songs as nodes and songs listened by same person as weights

* Kademlia Routing Protocol
* Implement in ILP

* include Skipnets in thesis

* setting TimeLimit to 10h did not produce optimal results for our ininital ILP idea
* I noticed gurobi finds the optimal value, but spends too much time trying to verify it  
* [Cuts](https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/9.1/refman/cuts.html)  
* [CutPasses](https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/9.1/refman/cutpasses.html)

### Discussion with Arash
* Implement SP-ILP with additional binary variable for min() or abs()
* Implement Constraint for enabling Kademlia-Routing
* Aim: Compare costs of optimal graph with and without Routing

### Gurobi ILP
* [NoRelHeurTime](https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/9.5/refman/norelheurtime.html)

## 6. July 
* Dataset from David: I can transform it to a Demand matrix
* Now focussing on related work: Shortcut-edge addition, Chord....
